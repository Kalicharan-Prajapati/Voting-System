# 🗳️ Decentralized Group Voting System

## 📘 Project Description

The **Decentralized Group Voting System** is a blockchain-powered platform that redefines collective decision-making. It enables communities, organizations, and groups to conduct transparent, secure, and tamper-proof voting without relying on centralized authorities.

## ⚙️ Smart Contract Methods

### 👥 Group Management
- `addGroupMember(address member)` – Add a new group member  
- `removeGroupMember(address member)` – Remove an existing group member  
- `isGroupMember(address)` – Check if an address is a group member  

### 📋 Proposal Lifecycle
- `createProposal(string description)` – Create a new proposal  
- `vote(uint proposalId, bool voteType)` – Cast a vote (`true` for yes, `false` for no)  
- `finalizeProposal(uint proposalId)` – Conclude and finalize a proposal  

### 🔍 Proposal Retrieval
- `getProposalDetails(uint proposalId)` – Get details about a specific proposal
